# Wallflower Safari band website
A React.js website I built to showcase my band, demonstrating my ability to learn independently and apply modern web development techniques. Whilst still a work in progress, I believe this project highlights my skills in React, component-based architecture, and front-end design.

## Project aims:
This was created as a personal project to:
- Launch my band's upcoming EP and boost online visilbity.
- Showcase my front-end development skills using React.js.
- Demonstrate my ability to learn independently and implement a full website project from scratch.
- Serve as a portfolio piece for potential employers.

## Features:
- **Responsive design:** Designed with a mobile first approach, the website also functions on tablet and desktop.
- **React components:** Modular and reusable components that can be used across different sections of the website, such as the header, footer and components.
- **Styling:** Styled components using CSS to maximize control over styles.
- **Navigation:** Smooth single-page navigation using React Router.
- **Media integration:** A responsive gallery of images and links to streaming services and social media pages.

## Tech stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js, React Router.
- **Styling:** CSS.

## Learning highlights:
- Gained hands on experience with React Router, and state management.
- Learned to structure React projects with modular components.
- Practised implementing responsive design principles.
- Strengthened ability to conduct independent research and solve problems independently.

## Further improvements:
- Still need to add content across site.
- Need to get logo, background and hero assets from my desktop computer once I have moved into my new house.
